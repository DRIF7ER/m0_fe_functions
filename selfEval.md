# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

> I am most proud of figuring out how to get my functions to preform more complex computations; I don't fully understand why the code works but, hey, wins a win lol.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

> Because you can make them as simple or complex as you want. they can have so many different steps with a bunch of different types of data inputs and spit out something different for a variety of criteria. Stuff's wild lol.
